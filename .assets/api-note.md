**_NOTE ON API USAGE:_** As you can see from the included examples, each _invocation_ of an API method looks like a less strict (more quirky) version of a typical javascript function invocation. 

It's less-strict to hopefully make expressing yourself (in a markdown-compliant way) easier. It's more quirky because it aims to ensure both markdown compliance and character usage that is [safe for URLs](https://support.exactonline.com/community/s/knowledge-base#All-All-DNO-Content-urlcharacters), all while remaining easy to read and write.
