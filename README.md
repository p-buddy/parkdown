# parkdown (pâ†“)

`parkdown` allows you to include other file's content within your markdown using a link with no text (i.e. `[](<url>)`), where `<url>` corresponds to either:
  - a local file, e.g. `[](./other.md)` or `[](../root.ts)`
  - **_COMING SOON_**: An external link 
o navigate to, improving productivity.

Collectively, [parkdown]() enables your documentation to behave a little more like code, and for your code to have a rightful place in your documentation.
